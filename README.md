# Granblue Fantasy Numerical HP Display

This extension for Chrome provides a numerical display for the HP of enemies in the mobile game [Granblue Fantasy](http://granbluefantasy.jp/). It is currently displayed within a panel in the developer tools console.

Of course, this only works if you are playing the game from within the browser with the developer tools console open. It will not work on mobile, as mobile Chrome does not support developer tools or extensions, nor if you are playing with the Chrome app.
